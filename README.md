### A simple xor cipher / decipher program
It's a simple program that can be compiled on your machine accordingly so that your system supports it. Though i didn't test its compatibility to windows, but if you have linux and g++ it should work.
## Functionality overview
# Ciphering
When in program interface type in "-c" followed by a string. That will get you a sequence of hex numbers in output file (output.xor) by default. Another user with the same version of this program can decipher it using his copy.
# Deciphering
When in program interface type in "-d" followed by a sequence of hex numbers with caps letters (aka 'A', 'B' and so on) to decipher it with set key. It output it's decoded value to output file (output.xor) by default.
# Outro
More features will be added in some time (when linal exam will be over to be exact (maybe earlier))
